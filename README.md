## Welcome

Welcome to the NodeJS implementation of a business managment and information system. This project is an implementation of
a human resource system and a business management system. it allows for things like staff managment, department managment, viewing key business metrics like expenses and revenues.

## Technology Stack

- **Node.js**: This application is built with the help of Node js. Node js is a javascript runtime that allows javascript to be run outside of the browser.

## App Features

- **Database Integration**: We use MongoDB as the database system for storing and retrieving information. The mongoose library is used to interact with the database.

* **Authentication and Authorization**: User authentication and authorization are implemented via a middleware,this allows for controlled access to different parts of the system and prevents unathorised changes.

* **RESTful APIs**: The system exposes RESTful APIs for various entities, enabling easy integration with frontend applications.

* **Configuration**: The server's configuration can be found in the config.js file. You can modify settings such as port numbers, database connections, and more.

* **Error Handling**: The server utilizes a error handling middleware to ensure proper handling of errors.

* **Modular Structure**: The server code is organized into modular components, promoting a clean and maintainable codebase.
